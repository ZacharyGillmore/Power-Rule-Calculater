-Limit the power_rule function to only working on a single term(this is because the tables will likely be used in other functions)
-Verify input by:
    -checking for invalid characters
    -checking for multiple variables in a term
    -checking for two operations in a row like '++' This can be done by comparing amount of 'terms' witb 'ops'
    -check for parenthises(either that or add distribution functionality)
-Format input by:
    -removing no variable terms
    -removing division
    -removing multiplication
    -add exponents to all variables (x=x^1) or add case to power rule function
-add GUI
